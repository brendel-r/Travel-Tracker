# Travel Wizard

## Introduction
Keeping track of past and upcoming trips and the amount of money spent can be a challenging task, especially for frequent travelers. It can be time-consuming to manually record all the details, and there is always the risk of missing important information.

However, with the help of Travel Wizard, the task of tracking trips and expenses becomes much easier. The application allows users to track a their trips as well as book future trips!

## Context 
 The project utilized a class-driven approach to develop a JavaScript application using HTML and CSS for the user interface. The application was tested using the Mocha and Chai testing frameworks to ensure the correctness of the code.

The class-driven approach involved creating several JavaScript classes, each responsible for a specific task in the application. The classes were designed to work together to achieve the overall functionality of the application.

The HTML and CSS were used to create a user-friendly interface for the application, making it easy for users to interact with the application and achieve their desired tasks.

To ensure that the application was working correctly, the Mocha and Chai testing frameworks were used to write and run tests on the application. These tests checked the functionality of each class, ensuring that they worked as intended and that the application as a whole was working correctly.

Overall, the project demonstrated the benefits of using a class-driven approach to JavaScript development, and the importance of testing to ensure the correctness of the code.
